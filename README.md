VEXTREME Vectrex Multicart
===

We're carrying on and pushing forward the amazing work of [Sprite_tm](http://spritesmods.com/?art=veccart&page=1) and his Extreme Vectrex Multicart. He posted the code (GPLv3 License) and lots of screens of the PCB/initial schematic, but he never released the PCB. It's a great base for an inexpensive and open multicart, for developers and players alike!

:warning: Please read this NOTICE of Current Development :warning:
===

**This project is a work in progress, and is not ready for mass production.**  Please observe the currently [posted issues](https://github.com/technobly/vextreme/issues) and there may be more lurking that are not yet identified.  The hardware and software is evolving.  You are free to build any version, contribute and/or follow along.  Please note that support of these pre-releases will be very limited and if you embark on an epic adventure to build one or a few, you should feel comfortable with this type of embedded hardware and software development.  There will be road bumps, but the journey is half the fun of the destination.  When things appear to be stable and we've worked out most of the kinks, we'll change the version to v1.0.  Only then is it advisable to mass produce.

BOM and Parts ordering
===

All the parts are described in [veccart.csv](bom/veccart.csv)

Also, you can use this [Digi-Key shared cart](https://www.digikey.com/short/zpdmtp) if you're in a hurry.  It has will have part references right on the packages for you!

Ordering PCB's
===

OSHPark is a good place to order with purple or the new "after dark" theme color scheme.  You can upload the KiCad [veccart.kicad_pcb](hardware/veccart.kicad_pcb) there directly.  I would download this entire Github repo ZIP file first though instead of just trying to save the PCB file from your browser.

Another way to order PCB's is by using the included [gerbers](hardware/gerbers) and uploading those with all of the necessary specs to companies like [PCBWay](https://www.pcbway.com) or [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com)

Building and Flashing STM firmware
===

### This assumes you have these prerequisits installed:

- Docker
- dfu-util v0.9
- Make
- Windows will also require these [Zadig instructions](https://github.com/profezzorn/ProffieOS/wiki/zadig)

### Build the stm32-build docker image
```
code/veccart $ make docker-build
```

### Connect the 2-pin jumper and then connect the cart to USB

### Check if your computer sees the STM32
```
$ dfu-util -l

dfu-util 0.9

### Build and flash the STM32 image via dfu-util
```
code/veccart $ make clean all flash USE_HW=v0.3

// NOTE: Use v0.2 above if you have v0.2 HW, or you may use v0.3 if you make the proper mods to your board.  See "Modifying v0.2 to v0.3"

// You should end up with something like this

### Remove the cart from USB and remove the jumper (install it on one pin so you don't lose it)


Building and Flashing the multicart's menu
===

### Build the asm6809 docker image
```
code/multicart $ make docker-build
```

### Connect the cart to USB with the 2-pin jumper removed

- The first time you do this you will likely have to format the USB drive

  - Name: VEXTREME
  - Format: MS-DOS (FAT)
  - Scheme: Master Boot Record
  - 512 byte page size

- Be patient, it's slow!  Don't worry, copying binaries later will be fast!!

### Build and flash the multicart menu binary
```
// Mac OS
code/multicart $ make clean all && cp multicart.bin /Volumes/VEXTREME/

// optionally add this to the above command to unmount, after you figure out which drive it is
$ diskutil list
&& diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk3

// Linux
code/multicart $ make copy

// You should end up with something like this, and the binary should have been copied to the root of your multicart drive

asm6809  -B -o multicart.bin multicart.asm
```

Modifying v0.2 to v0.3
===

![v0.3 Mod 1](images/v0.3-mod1.png)

- To get the new reset feature of v0.3, as of v0.24 software you will need to jumper V-OE pin 12 of the cart fingers (or U3 pin 9) to STM32 pin 29 (PB10).  This may change in the future, don't sell your soldering iron!
- The wire mod above also allows you to play Animaction on VEXTREME!
- More TBD


Adding Vectrex Game ROMs (Binaries)
===

- Create a directory on your multicart called `roms/`

- Add your first binaries there, may I suggest: [Beluga Dreams](https://8-bit-waves.itch.io/beluga-dreams) and [Vec-Man](http://eiti.fh-pforzheim.de/personen/johannsen/projektlabor/vectrex_2019/vectrex_game_vec_man.htm) ?

A nice collection of lessons learned will be [documented here.](docs/)


Hall of Fame
