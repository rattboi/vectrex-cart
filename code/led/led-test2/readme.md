LED Test v2.0
===

This app tests the LED controls between Vectrex games and the VEXTREME cart.

There is purposely no video displayed so that the noise from vectors remains silent.  This way you can more easily hear the effects of the LEDs and how it relates to issue #46

1. Button 1 - Cycle down through colors, stopping at off (0)
2. Button 2 - Cycle up through colors, stopping at white (9)
3. Button 3 - Cycle down through brightness, stopping at off (0)
4. Button 3 - Cycle up through brightness, stopping at max (31)

:warning: **NOTE: Be careful NOT to leave the cart at MAX brightness with WHITE LEDs because it draws too much current.** :warning:
